- Unemployment insurance and asset holdings: [[Paper]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ydvo8m5a5xgl2ut/WS.pdf?dl=0)
  - <font size="3.25">Abstract:</font> <font size="3">I develop a heterogeneous agent model with incomplete financial markets and labor-market frictions to analyze Unemployment insurance in general equilibrium. Agents are subject to idiosyncratic employment shocks. Employed agents work and accumulate wealth to smooth their consumption during the unemployment spell. Also, both employed and unemployed agents can search for a job based on the wages and assets. Search in the labor market is directed; firms enter the market by posting vacancies and matching with one agent until the zero-profit condition is satisfied. First, I consider constant UI (constant during time) and measure welfare gain for different levels of replacement rate. Second, I analyze other time dependent UI policies.
