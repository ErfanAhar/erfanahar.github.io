I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Economics](https://cla.umn.edu/economics) at the University of Minnesota. Prior to this, I earned a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and a master's degree in Economics in Iran. You can find more details about my academic background in my CV.

My research primarily focuses on macroeconomics, with a strong interest in public and labor economics. I utilize theoretical frameworks and computational tools to analyze economic dynamics and policy implications.
