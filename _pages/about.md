I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Economics at the University of Minnesota](https://cla.umn.edu/economics) and a [Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/economic-research/economists). I hold a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and an M.A. in Economics from Iran. More details about my academic background are available in my [CV](https://erfanahar.github.io/cv/).

My research primarily focuses on macroeconomics, with a strong interest in public and labor economics. I utilize theoretical frameworks and computational tools to analyze economic dynamics and policy implications!
